# Web-Scraping-Data-Anaylsis

This project is centered around the utilization of web scraping techniques to gather data regarding the diplomatic endeavors of Iceland, a specific country. Typically, each country maintains a website for its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where they publish updates and news related to their diplomatic activities. The primary objective is to scrape all the diplomatic activity news articles shared on Iceland's official Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.

The project is structured into four main tasks:

- Collecting Links: The initial step involves gathering links to individual news articles published on the website.
- Downloading HTML Pages: Once the links are collected, the next phase is to download the HTML pages corresponding to these links.
- Parsing and Data Extraction: Following the successful downloading of HTML files, the project focuses on parsing these files and extracting the relevant information contained within them.
- Data Analysis: Lastly, the collected and extracted data is analyzed, providing valuable insights and patterns related to Iceland's diplomatic activities.

In summary, this project aims to automate the process of collecting, downloading, parsing, and analyzing diplomatic news articles from Iceland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of their diplomatic endeavors.
